This is where I backup my xmonad tiling window manager configuration.

The config folder has a replica of the files I need within the linux /usr folder tree, for setting up things like sessions, etc.

To install, clone repository to ~/.xmonad and then either copy the config/usr folder to /usr, or create symlinks
